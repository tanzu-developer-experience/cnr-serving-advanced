This workshop will walk you through the fundamentals of Cloud Native Runtimes for VMware Tanzu. 

**What is Cloud Native Runtimes for VMware Tanzu**

***Cloud Native Runtimes for VMware Tanzu*** includes Knative (pronounced kay-nay-tiv), an open source community project which adds components for deploying, running, and managing serverless, cloud-native applications to Kubernetes, and manages the deployment and ingress for you. Users interact with the CNR using the Knative "kn" CLI.  


***Make your developers more productive.***
CNR builds on top of Kubernetes, abstracting away the complex details and enabling developers to focus on what matters. Built by codifying the best practices shared by successful real-world implementations, CNR solves the "boring but difficult" parts of deploying and managing cloud native services so you don't have to.
