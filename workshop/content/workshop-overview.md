As of this writing ***Cloud Native Runtimes for VMware Tanzu***(CNR) includes one runtime, based on the open source Knative project, with more to come in the future. It enables developers to leverage the power of Kubernetes for serverless use cases without first having to master the Kubernetes API.

Knative has two major subprojects: **Serving** is responsible for deploying, upgrading, routing and **Eventing** is responsible for connecting disparate systems. 

This workshop is intended for folks who want to learn the fundamental components and capabilities of **Knative Serving** in more detail. A basic understanding of Kubernetes concepts is recommended to be able to understand the full workshop.

The workshop is based on the book "Knative in Action" by Jacques Chester which is available as free download here: https://tanzu.vmware.com/content/ebooks/knative-in-action
